    abstract: "The ‘GoinmulLook’ meme points to two prominent themes with costumes. In some games, costumes indicate the strength of the players or the characters that they play in two ways.  In some games, costumes are given to players under certain conditions -long  playtimes,  reaching  certain  levels,  or  completing  difficult  tasks.  Wearing costumes that can only be obtained by spending a lotof time and resources indicates that the player is competent. Also, when costumes function as armor, they are directly involved in gameplay by increasing the strength of the game avatars. So,the higher level armor an avatar wears, the stronger the avatar becomes. But here is the paradox: ‘Goinmuls’ tend to show their strength by not equipping armor. They deliberately equip low-level armor, or walk naked, to show that they are strong enough to not need  the  aid  of  armor.  By  revealing  their  vulnerability,  they  boast  of  their  strong masculinity. In other words, being vulnerable paradoxically shows that the player is powerful."
