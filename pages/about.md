# **About Me**

Hi I am **Yeonwoo Lee** :wave:,<br>
<p> <p>Through my work, I explore the histories and untold stories behind gaming worlds, from classic titles that laid the foundations of gaming culture to the virtual spaces of today that are constantly evolving. I believe that games are not just entertainment, but complex social ecosystems where people form meaningful connections and express their creativity. My passion for <strong>the decoration of digital lives</strong>—whether through avatars, in-game spaces, or user-generated content—drives me to examine the ways players construct their identities in these virtual environments.</p> <p>As part of my research in <strong>Game Archaeology</strong>, I delve into the artifacts, designs, and mechanics of older games to understand how they inform current gaming trends and behaviors. I love uncovering how past innovations continue to shape modern game culture and digital worlds, linking the old with the new.</p> <p>Whether I'm analyzing the socio-cultural impacts of games or curating exhibitions that showcase gaming history, I’m dedicated to deepening the understanding of games as significant cultural artifacts. I aim to bridge the gap between academic research and the vibrant world of gaming, making it accessible and engaging to a broader audience.</p>
