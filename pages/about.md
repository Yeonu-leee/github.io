# **About Me**

Hi, I’m Yeonwoo Lee :wave:,  

I’m a game researcher deeply interested in how people connect and form communities through games. For me, games are not just digital experiences but vibrant social spaces where identities are shaped, cultures emerge, and relationships flourish. I explore how these virtual worlds both influence and reflect broader societal behaviors and trends.  

My work focuses on understanding how games foster connection, creativity, and shared experiences. From the ways players collaborate and communicate in online spaces to the evolution of gaming communities over time, I aim to uncover the social dynamics that define these unique ecosystems.  

Through my efforts—whether analyzing the socio-cultural impacts of games or curating exhibitions on gaming history—I strive to reveal the profound role of games as social ecosystems and cultural artifacts. My goal is to bridge academic insights with the lived experiences of players, highlighting how games enrich our understanding of society.
